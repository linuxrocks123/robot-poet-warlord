robot-poet-warlord
==================

CSCI 1301 and higher Robot-Poet-Warlord repository.

See http://moongate.ydns.eu/robot-poet-warlord for generated documentation.  To run, you generally do javac *.java then run "java SimulatorGUI".  I used Java 7; it might work with lower versions, but I don't know.

It's not done yet.  It's not well-tested.  Stuff doesn't work.  I'll try to remember to update this line when more stuff works.
